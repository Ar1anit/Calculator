My First JavaScript Project: Calculator

This is my first JavaScript project, a calculator application. I'm excited to learn more about JavaScript and explore the power of this popular programming language.

Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to build a simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I'm using JavaScript to handle the user interactions and to make the application dynamic and responsive.

Project Structure:

Here's an overview of the project structure:

- index.html: This is the main HTML file that loads the JavaScript and CSS files and defines the structure of the page.
- script.js: This is the main JavaScript file that contains all the code for the calculator logic and user interactions.
- style.css: This is the CSS file that defines the styles and layout for the HTML elements.

Running the Project:

To run the project, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You should see the calculator application running and ready to use.

How to Use the Calculator
- Enter a number using the number keys on the calculator.
- Select an arithmetic operation using the corresponding buttons (+, -, x, รท).
- Enter a second number using the number keys.
- Press the equals button (=) to perform the calculation.
- The result will be displayed on the calculator screen.

Conclusion:

I'm excited to continue learning more about JavaScript and to build more advanced applications in the future. Thanks for checking out my first JavaScript project, a calculator application!
